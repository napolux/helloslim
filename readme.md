HelloSlim
=========

A starter kit for small PHP Projects containing the [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/) microframework, [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as Template Engine and [ReadBeanPHP](http://redbeanphp.com/) as ORM.
If you use PHPUnit for tests, the ```/tests``` folder is there, just for you to use :P
